    "## Project Introduction\n",
    "In this project, I will assume the role of a data analyst tasked with analyzing employee exit surveys from two institutes: the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The stakeholders are interested in understanding whether employees who resigned from the institutes due to dissatisfaction had short tenures and whether age plays a role in employee resignations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets I will be working with are dete_survey.csv and tafe_survey.csv. These datasets contain information about employees' demographics, employment details, and reasons for resignation. The dete_survey.csv includes columns such as ID, SeparationType, Cease Date, and DETE Start Date, while the tafe_survey.csv includes columns such as Record ID, Reason for ceasing employment, and LengthofServiceOverall.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will begin our analysis by importing the necessary libraries and exploring the datasets to gain insights into the data structure and variables."

Since the `dete_survey_updated` DataFrame contains three different types of resignation separations, I ensured to select all of them. To prevent any potential issues related to chained indexing and to ensure data integrity, I used the `DataFrame.copy()` method on the filtered results, creating copies of the DataFrames instead of working directly on the originals. This helps avoid the SettingWithCopy Warning and ensures that modifications made to the filtered DataFrames won't affect the original DataFrames. The filtered DataFrames were then assigned to `dete_resignations` and `tafe_resignations`, respectively."

    "In the provided code snippet, several adjustments were made to preprocess the data in the `tafe_resignations` dataframe effectively. Initially, a function named `update_vals` was defined to handle the transformation of values within specific columns. This function systematically replaced NaN values with `np.nan`, hyphen ('-') values with `False`, and any other value with `True`, ensuring standardized data suitable for further analysis. Subsequently, the `applymap` method was utilized to apply the `update_vals` function element-wise to the columns 'Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction' and 'Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction'. By doing so, the values in these columns were uniformly transformed according to the criteria specified in the `update_vals` function. Finally, copies of the `dete_resignations` and `tafe_resignations` dataframes were created using the `copy()` method to avoid the `SettingWithCopy` warning and maintain the integrity of the original dataframes for subsequent modifications or analyses. Overall, these adjustments ensure that the data in the specified columns of the `tafe_resignations` dataframe are appropriately standardized, while also preserving the integrity of the original dataframes through the use of copies."
